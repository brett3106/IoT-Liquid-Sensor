# IoT-Liquid-Sensor
Uses the CubeCell board and LoRa to detect if a hand sanitizer station is empty
and then comunicates this information to a receiver which is conneted to thwe internet 
via wifi. A friebase page creates a user friendly interface to read the sensor data

CubeCell LoRa development board:

This code requires use of an arduino IDE, and the proper drivers and board 
manager avaliable from:

Aditionally serial connection requires the driver:
